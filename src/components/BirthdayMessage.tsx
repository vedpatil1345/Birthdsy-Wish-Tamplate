You may not be my sister by blood,
but you're definitely my sister by heart and that’s even more special (plus fewer RRs and ghar ki chugliya, more fun, right? 😎).
From being my best friend to being my strongest support,
you've filled my life with laughter, love, and unforgettable memories
and some highly questionable decisions that we'll pretend never happened 😂. On your special day, I just want to say:
Thank you for being you kind, caring, strong, and always real.
Even when you’re being a drama queen or crying for the future every 2nd day 💀
May this year bring you endless joy, success, and all the happiness you truly deserve
plus unlimited choco 🍫, no responsibilities, and zero "are you free to talk?" texts 😅🎂
Keep glowing, keep growing, and always know that you're loved beyond measure.
I'll always be here for you, no matter what...
Even when you call me just to rant about something that happened in your dream 😂💕
Happy Birthday, my soul sister! 🥳🎂💖
Now go slay your day like it’s a Bollywood movie finale ✨🎬`;
